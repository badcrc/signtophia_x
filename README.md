# signtophia_x
My really old old old (2003 old) Dreamcast demo. I think I learned coding in C (and coding in general) a year before.

Was 3rd in that year's Euskal Encounter's Wild compo demo! but basically there are just [NeHe](http://nehe.gamedev.net/) OpenGL demos, with some artwork from the signatures of the [Frozen-Layer](https://www.frozen-layer.com) users and some L'Arc~~en~~Ciel music (which is copyrighted, so a placeholder file is it's place).

This is the version compiled for Mac OS X. Probably won't compile now. You can download a Dreamcast binary and try it with an emulator [Scene.org](https://files.scene.org/view/parties/2004/euskal12/wild/signtophia.zip). 

It uses [KOS](http://gamedev.allusion.net/softprj/kos/) as framework.
